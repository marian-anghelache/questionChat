  "I take a long acting insulin twice a day and a fast acting insulin three times a day. I've been told how often to take them and how much to take, but nobody ever told me if I should still take it when my glucose is within range or not.

It’s so unusual because all my life I’ve never been overweight. I’m extremely worried because I have dieted and exercise but nothing is changing.
